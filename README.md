1. Project Title

Title: Cab Booking System Data Analysis using SQL

2. Introduction

This project is a Cab Booking System Data Analysis Project implemented using MySQL. The database is designed to manage customers, drivers, cabs, bookings, and payments. SQL queries are used to analyze booking trends, driver performance, customer activity, and revenue generation.

3. Objectives

Design a structured relational database

Create and manage database tables

Insert, update, and delete records

Perform data analysis using SQL queries

Extract meaningful insights using joins, aggregations, and filters

4. Tools & Technologies Used

Database: MySQL

Query Language: SQL

Client Tool: MySQL Workbench

Operating System: Windows

5. Dataset Description
5.1 Data Source

The dataset is self-created and inserted manually using SQL INSERT statements to simulate a real-world cab booking platform.

5.2 Tables Overview
Table Name	Description
Customers	Stores customer personal and registration details
Drivers	Stores driver details and ratings
Cabs	Stores cab and vehicle information
Bookings	Stores trip booking details
Payments	Stores payment and fare information
6. Database Schema Design
